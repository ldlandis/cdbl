1994
12/01 Got quite a bit hacked.  gram.g is closer (compiles clean), but
      still have some action code to do.  Need to address lex.l, still
      old scheme.  Put this log (Log) and TimeLog into reverse order so
      most current is on top, and changed to RCS header in these files.
11/30 Debugged (I think) node, and started putting gram/lex/node
      together.  Back up.  Needing to work out net structures for parsed
      stuff.
11/27 Debugging node code (via node_qa).  Still needing work.  Checkin.
11/26 Got mktokens.awk to work the way I wanted, and started mashing
      lex.l to fit.  Need to find the DIBOL reference manual for some
      operators!  (don't know what and/or/not/etc are).
11/25 Hacked mktokens.awk.  Got check from TSI.
11/22 Continue developing node.{c,h}.
11/20 Began to developing nodes, but was reminded to honor the Sabbath.
11/19 Completed initial pass at action code.  Began the initial pass at
      the lexical analyzer.
11/18 Began adding action code to gram.g.  Haven't started lex.l/node.c.
      Finished initial pass of action code.
11/16 Continued gram.g, started to yacc it.  Have 16 shift/reduce
      conflicts to resolve, and a strange "undefined result assigned to
      $$" in the "stmt: assignment" production (line 412).  Need to
      examine to see if significant enough to worry about before
      proceeding.  May start to hack in building the symbol table.
      Next steps, hack lex.l and node.c.  Not planning to use C++ at
      this time.
11/15 Continued, hacked node.h to define a "tangled net" structure.
      I want to see how well it works in a compiler.
11/14 Continued gram.g
11/12 Began lex.l, gram.g and ref using DIBOL reference manual
